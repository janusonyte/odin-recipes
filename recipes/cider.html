    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Cider is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples. Cider is widely available in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ripe pears</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Acid blend</li>
        <li>Yeast nutrient</li>
        <li>Wine yeast</li>
        <li>Fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Yeast energizer</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the pears. Cut them in half and remove the core and any bad spots. Leave the skin on. Place the pears in a brew pot or a large stockpot</li>
        <li>Boil 4 cups of water. Pour the boiling water over the pears, then use a masher to mash the pears and extract the juice.</li>
        <li>Bring the remaining 14 cups of water to a boil, then pour the boiling water over the mashed pears.</li>
        <li>Put a lid on the pot and stash it in a quiet corner of your house.</li>
        <li>After 24 hours, add the sugar, acid blend, yeast nutrient, tannin, and lemon juice. Stir well to mix the ingredients. Follow the instructions on your yeast package (some will require re-hydrating before use). Add the yeast to the brew pot and stir it again. Give everything another good stir after one hour to make sure it is well mixed. If you want to calculate the alcohol levels, remove some of the liquid at this point to measure the specific gravity.</li>
        <li>Put the lid back on the pot and leave it somewhere warm to ferment for 3-5 days. Give the mixture a good stir once or twice a day.</li>
        <li>After the initial ferment, strain out the solids by pouring the liquid through a mesh bag or a cheesecloth-lined strainer (sanitized). Move the liquid into carboys, top them with an airlock, and leave them to ferment in a dark location, cool for 2 weeks.</li>
        <li>After 2 weeks the fermenting should have slowed significantly. However, you should see some bubbling in the airlock. This is when itâ€™s ready to bottle for cider. The exact timing will depend on temperature. The ideal temperature is 68 F / 20 C. Cooler temperatures will slow down the fermentation time. Warmer temperatures will speed it up.</li>
        <li>Allow the bottles to sit out at room temperature for 1 week to carbonate. Test carbonation by squeezing plastic bottles or popping the lid on glass bottles.</li>
        <li>Once the pear cider is carbonated store it in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
