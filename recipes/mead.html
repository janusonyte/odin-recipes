    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Mead (/miÀêd/) is an alcoholic beverage made by fermenting honey mixed with water, and sometimes with added ingredients such as fruits, spices, grains, or hops.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Mead yeast</li>
        <li>Fruit of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix honey and water together in a container of choice, whether that be bucket or demijohn.</li>
        <li>Add mead yeast and some sort of additional nutrition to the honey water mixture. The added nutrition might be fruit, such as raisins.</li>
        <li>Fit the airlock to your vessel and wait. The yeast will start to work, turning the sugar into CO2 and alcohol. The airlock ensures no contaminants get in but the CO2 gets out, making a satisfying 'bloop'. This first fermentation could take anything from 2 weeks to a month depending on the recipe and the temperature.</li>
        <li>When the bubbling stops, that tells you the first fermentation is finished. Transfer the mead to a second bucket or demijohn, leaving the sediment behind. Store in a dark place for about 2 months.</li>
        <li>Bottle and label.</li>
    </ol>
